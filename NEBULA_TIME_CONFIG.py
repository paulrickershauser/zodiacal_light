"""
NEBULA_TIME_CONFIG.py

Time-window and propagation-step configuration for the NEBULA
(Neuromorphic Event-Based Luminance Asset-tracking) simulation framework.

This module is responsible ONLY for describing:

  - The default simulation time window (start and end timestamps).
  - The default "base" propagation time step.
  - Tuning parameters for adaptive time stepping (e.g. minimum and
    maximum allowed dt, and how finely to sample short visibility
    windows).

It deliberately does NOT implement any actual time-parsing or SGP4
propagation.  Those behaviors will live in other NEBULA modules
(e.g. a future NEBULA_TIME_UTIL for parsing, and NEBULA_PROPAGATOR
for orbit propagation).  This file just provides configuration
objects that those modules can read.

    """
    Configuration object describing a single simulation time window.

    This object stores the start and end of a time interval as strings,
    rather than as datetime objects, because the *parsing* of those
    strings into timezone-aware UTC datetimes is the job of a separate
    utility (for example, a NEBULA_TIME_UTIL module).

    Fields
    ------
    start_utc :
        Start of the simulation window, expressed as an ISO8601-like
        string (e.g. "2025-11-10T00:00:00").

    end_utc :
        End of the simulation window, expressed in the same format.

    label :
        Optional human-readable description of what this window
        represents (e.g. "Nominal 24-hour GEO survey").

class PropagationStepConfig:
    """
    Configuration object describing NEBULA's propagation time steps.

    This object groups together both the base (fixed) time step that
    you use for coarse propagation, and the tuning parameters that any
    *adaptive* time-stepping logic should respect.

    It does not perform any computations itself; instead, a future
    NEBULA_PROPAGATOR module can import this configuration and use the
    values when implementing functions like `compute_adaptive_dt`.

    Fields
    ------
    base_dt_s :
        Default propagation time step in seconds.  This corresponds to
        the DEFAULT_DT value you previously used in AMOS_config.

    adaptive_min_dt_s :
        Minimum allowable time step when refining adaptively.  This
        protects you from choosing absurdly small dt values.

    adaptive_max_dt_s :
        Maximum allowable time step when refining adaptively.  This
        protects you from dt becoming too large and skipping over short
        visibility windows.

    adaptive_samples_per_window :
        Target number of time samples across a "short" visibility
        window when adaptive stepping is in effect.  For example, a
        value of 20 means: if the analytic geometry predicts a short
        window of duration T_max, the adaptive logic should aim for
        roughly 20 samples across that interval.
    """
