"""
NEBULA_STAR_CONFIG.py

This configuration module defines how the NEBULA simulation chooses and
describes its stellar *catalog* and how it typically *queries* that
catalog around a field of view.

The intent is very narrow on purpose:

  - This file answers: "Which stars are we calling upon, and how do we
    usually ask for them?"

  - It does NOT configure:
      * diffuse sky background models,
      * telescope collecting area,
      * optical throughput,
      * detector noise.

    Those topics live in other NEBULA_* configuration modules
    (for example, a future NEBULA_BACKGROUND_CONFIG).

NEBULA code that needs star catalog information should import from this
file rather than hard-coding catalog names, band labels, or query
parameters.  This helps keep the "Gaia wiring" in one place.

    """
    Describe a single stellar catalog + band that NEBULA can use.

    This class is a simple "configuration object" that groups together
    the metadata needed to understand a catalog:

      - a short internal name (e.g. "GAIA_DR3_G"),
      - a human-readable description,
      - the underlying table or dataset identifier (e.g. a Gaia TAP table),
      - which column holds the magnitude in the chosen band,
      - the band name itself ("G", "V", "r", etc.),
      - the catalog release/version ("DR2", "DR3", ...),
      - the astrometric reference epoch (e.g. 2016.0 for Gaia DR3),
      - optionally, which columns hold magnitudes in auxiliary bands
        (e.g. Gaia BP/RP).

    It does NOT fetch any data by itself; it is just a structured
    description that other NEBULA modules (e.g. NEBULA_QUERY_GAIA) can
    read when building queries or interpreting catalog results.

    This is another configuration object.  It does not perform any
    queries itself; it just encodes *policy*:

      - how far beyond the strict field-of-view we search (angular padding),
      - how much deeper than the sensor's limiting magnitude we ask
        the catalog to go (magnitude buffer),
      - a maximum row limit (to avoid unexpectedly huge queries),
      - whether or not NEBULA should attempt to use catalog proper
        motions when computing star positions at the observation epoch,
      - which extra columns we want (BP/RP, parallax, RUWE, variability),
      - which query engine we intend to use ("astroquery" vs "local").
