"""
NEBULA_POINTING_CONFIG.py

Pointing-mode configuration for the NEBULA (Neuromorphic Event-Based
Luminance Asset-tracking) simulation framework.

This module is responsible ONLY for describing high-level pointing
strategies and their tunable parameters.  It does not perform any
geometry, coordinate transforms, or line-of-sight intersection tests.
Those behaviors are implemented in runtime utilities such as
NEBULA_POINTING.py, NEBULA_VISIBILITY.py, and any WCS / sensor
projection helpers.

In practice, this file provides:

  - An enumeration of supported pointing modes (PointingMode),
    including:
        * A fixed ICRS RA/Dec stare with Earth-avoidance gating
          (FIXED_ICRS_EARTH_AVOID).
        * An "anti-Sun stare" mode for dawn–dusk sun-synchronous
          LEO platforms that stare toward the midnight / anti-Sun
          sector (ANTI_SUN_STARE).  In this mode, the actual
          boresight RA/Dec are computed at runtime from the Sun
          ephemeris and are NOT hard-coded here.

  - A PointingConfig dataclass that collects the mode selection and
    a small set of tunable parameters that downstream runtime code
    can interpret when computing the boresight direction and rolling
    the focal plane.

  - A DEFAULT_POINTING_CONFIG instance for use when no pointing
    configuration is supplied explicitly.

  - A describe_pointing_config() helper for logging / debugging,
    mirroring the pattern used in NEBULA_TIME_CONFIG.

By design, this module keeps imports minimal (standard-library only)
and avoids heavy dependencies such as astropy or skyfield.  That makes
it safe to import in any environment where configuration is needed,
without triggering geometry or ephemeris machinery.

Typical usage
-------------

A runtime pointing helper (e.g. NEBULA_POINTING.py) might:

  1. Import this module and read DEFAULT_POINTING_CONFIG (or a
     user-provided PointingConfig instance).

  2. Branch on the config.mode field to determine which pointing law
     to apply (fixed RA/Dec vs anti-Sun stare, etc.).

  3. Use the remaining fields (roll_deg, earth_avoid_margin_deg,
     require_sensor_sunlit, sun_exclusion_angle_deg, etc.) as knobs
     when computing the boresight RA/Dec, checking Earth occlusion,
     and building a WCS for sensor projection.

This separation keeps the configuration declarative while leaving the
actual numerical logic in dedicated utility modules.

    """
    Enumeration of supported high-level pointing modes in NEBULA.

    The enumeration values are string-based so that they are easy to
    serialize (e.g., into JSON), log, or use as keys in configuration
    dictionaries.

    Modes
    -----
    FIXED_ICRS_EARTH_AVOID :
        The sensor boresight is held at a fixed right ascension and
        declination in the ICRS frame.  At runtime, a pointing helper
        will:
          * Convert the stored (boresight_ra_deg, boresight_dec_deg)
            into a unit vector in the same inertial frame used for
            the observer state.
          * Evaluate whether the corresponding line-of-sight passes
            through the Earth, using the global blocking radius
            R_BLOCK from NEBULA_ENV_CONFIG.
          * Optionally enforce an additional angular "limb margin"
            given by earth_avoid_margin_deg to keep the boresight
            away from the bright Earth limb.

    ANTI_SUN_STARE :
        A higher-level mode that represents an "anti-Sun stare"
        geometry for a dawn–dusk sun-synchronous LEO platform
        observing GEO targets near the midnight sector.

        In this mode, the actual boresight RA/Dec are NOT specified
        directly in this configuration file.  Instead, a runtime
        pointing helper will:
          * Compute the instantaneous anti-Sun direction in ICRS
            from the Sun ephemeris (e.g., RA_sun(t) + 180 deg).
          * Optionally apply a small offset to better align with the
            GEO belt.
          * Apply Earth-avoidance logic using the global R_BLOCK and
            earth_avoid_margin_deg.
          * Optionally enforce a Sun exclusion angle given by
            sun_exclusion_angle_deg, if non-zero.

        The configuration fields in PointingConfig still apply to
        this mode, but the boresight_ra_deg and boresight_dec_deg
        fields are interpreted as "unused" (or as optional offsets),
        depending on how NEBULA_POINTING.py chooses to implement
        the anti-Sun stare law.
        
    ANTI_SUN_GEO_BELT :
        A sidereal (fixed-ICRS) stare optimized for GEO observations
        from a dawn–dusk sun-synchronous LEO platform.

        In this mode, a runtime pointing helper will:
          * Choose a single reference time within the simulation
            window (e.g., the midpoint of the time grid) that
            represents the "midnight sector" / Earth-shadow geometry,
            following the dawn–dusk + anti-Sun logic discussed in the
            pointing strategy paper. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
          * Compute the anti-Sun right ascension at that reference
            time, α_ref = α_sun(t_ref) + 180 deg (mod 360).
          * Set the boresight declination to δ_ref = 0 deg so that the
            boresight lies on the GEO belt (Earth's equatorial plane),
            effectively "snapping" the anti-Sun direction onto the GEO
            ring.
          * Hold (α_ref, δ_ref) fixed for the entire observation
            window so that stars remain stationary in the field of
            view (sidereal stare) while GEO objects drift at ~15″/s.
          * Apply Earth-avoidance, sensor-sunlit, and Sun-exclusion
            logic using the same configuration fields as the other
            modes (earth_avoid_margin_deg, require_sensor_sunlit,
            sun_exclusion_angle_deg).

        The boresight_ra_deg and boresight_dec_deg fields in
        PointingConfig are not used to *define* this mode; instead,
        the runtime implementation derives a fixed boresight from the
        Sun ephemeris as described above.

class PointingConfig:
    """
    High-level pointing configuration for NEBULA.

    This dataclass collects both the pointing mode selection and the
    small set of tunable parameters that downstream runtime modules
    use to compute the sensor boresight, enforce Earth-avoidance
    constraints, and (optionally) enforce Sun-exclusion constraints.

    Fields
    ------
    mode :
        The high-level pointing strategy to use, represented as a
        PointingMode enumeration value.  Downstream code can branch
        on this value to decide whether to:
          * Use the fixed ICRS RA/Dec fields directly
            (FIXED_ICRS_EARTH_AVOID), or
          * Derive the boresight direction from the anti-Sun
            geometry (ANTI_SUN_STARE).

    boresight_ra_deg :
        Right ascension of the desired boresight direction in the
        ICRS frame, in degrees.  This field is primarily used when
        mode == FIXED_ICRS_EARTH_AVOID.  For the ANTI_SUN_STARE mode,
        downstream code may ignore this field or treat it as an
        optional RA offset to be applied to the anti-Sun vector.

    boresight_dec_deg :
        Declination of the desired boresight direction in the ICRS
        frame, in degrees.  As with boresight_ra_deg, this is mainly
        used for the FIXED_ICRS_EARTH_AVOID mode.  In the
        ANTI_SUN_STARE mode, it may be ignored or treated as a Dec
        offset, depending on the chosen implementation.

    boresight_roll_deg :
        Rotation of the focal plane about the boresight, in degrees.
        A roll of 0 degrees corresponds to a convention where the
        detector +y axis aligns with increasing Declination in the
        local tangent plane of the WCS.  Positive roll is a
        right-hand rotation about the boresight.  This field applies
        to all pointing modes.

    earth_avoid_margin_deg :
        Additional angular clearance, in degrees, by which the
        boresight must clear the Earth's apparent limb before runtime
        pointing code will consider a direction usable.  At runtime,
        this margin is combined with the geometric blocking radius
        R_BLOCK from NEBULA_ENV_CONFIG.  A value of 0.0 means "allow
        pointing right up to the geometric limb defined by R_BLOCK."

    require_sensor_sunlit :
        If True, downstream runtime logic may choose to treat frames
        when the observer (sensor platform) is in Earth's shadow as
        "non-science" or "not valid," reflecting operational power
        constraints of real missions (e.g., preferring operations
        only when the spacecraft is sunlit).  If False, eclipse vs
        sunlit status is ignored by the pointing configuration, and
        all timesteps are potentially usable from a geometry
        standpoint.

    sun_exclusion_angle_deg :
        Optional angular exclusion radius around the Sun direction,
        in degrees.  If set to a positive value, runtime pointing
        code can choose to:
          * Reject boresight directions that lie within this angle
            of the Sun (for hardware safety), or
          * Flag such frames separately for "high dynamic range" or
            "torture test" simulations.
        A value of 0.0 disables Sun-exclusion constraints at the
        configuration level (runtime code may still impose its own
        safety limits if desired).

    Notes
    -----
    This configuration object is intentionally "dumb": it encodes
    only parameters and does not know how to interpret them.  The
    actual behavior of each pointing mode (e.g. how to compute the
    anti-Sun vector, how to check Earth limb clearance, how to
    enforce Sun exclusion) is left to NEBULA_POINTING.py and the
    rest of the runtime geometry pipeline.
